# gcp-ml-api-deployment
Deployment project of fine-tune a 7B parameter LLM AI model, exposed as a production-ready API endpoint on GCP using Docker and FastAPI.

# GCP ML API Deployment – Falcon-7B LoRA Adapter  
Deploying a fine-tuned 7B LLM as a production-ready REST API using Google Cloud, Docker, and FastAPI.

This project demonstrates the full lifecycle of taking a large-scale language model (Falcon-7B-Instruct), fine-tuning it using LoRA, and deploying it as a callable API endpoint on a CPU-only Google Cloud VM.  
It includes training, optimization, containerization, networking, and API exposure.

# 🚀 Overview

The primary goal of this project is to fine-tune a 7B parameter model and run it in a **resource-constrained CPU environment**.  
Since 7B models normally require a GPU, several optimizations were introduced:

- Training LoRA adapters on **Kaggle GPU** due to GCP GPU unavailability  
- Running inference on **CPU** using optimized memory loading  
- Utilizing **FastAPI** to expose model inference as REST endpoints  
- Packaging the entire service in **Docker** for reproducibility  
- Hosting on **GCP Compute Engine** with proper firewall & networking setup  

Even on CPU, the API is operational and suitable for demo, testing, and prototyping (response time 1–3 minutes).

# 🧠 Model Details

| Component | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Base Model | `tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct` |
| Fine-tuning | LoRA adapters (trained via Kaggle + Tinker workflow) |
| Serving Hardware | GCP Compute Engine (CPU only) |
| Format | PyTorch |
| Frameworks | transformers, peft, accelerate, torch |

# 🏗️ Architecture

Client → FastAPI → Docker Container → Falcon-7B Model + LoRA → CPU Inference → Response

---

# 📚 Training Workflow (Kaggle GPU)

1. Prepared dataset & notebook for LoRA fine-tuning  
2. Enabled **Kaggle GPU (T4)**  
3. Fine-tuned Falcon-7B using low-rank adapters  
4. Exported `lora-devotee/` directory  
5. Added LoRA weights to Docker image for deployment

```

Response:
```json
{"message": "Devotee Chat API running!"}
```

---

## 2️⃣ Chat Inference – POST `/chat`
```

# 🛑 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Reason | Fix |
|-------|--------|------|
| OOM error (Out Of Memory) | Model too large for RAM | Used accelerate offloading |
| Git auth failed | Password login deprecated | Use SSH key or PAT |
| Port unreachable | Firewall closed | Allow TCP:8000 |
| Docker build slow | Large model files | Expected (10–20 mins) |
| `/chat` not working in browser | Only accepts POST | Use curl or Postman |

---

# 📈 Future Enhancements

- Deploy on GPU VM for fast inference  
- Add request streaming  
- Add authentication & rate limits  
- Quantize model (4-bit GGUF)  
- Serve via vLLM or TGI for high throughput
